# Text-to-Speech

## Description
The Text-to-Speech application is a web-based tool that allows users to convert text into spoken words. Users can input text into a textarea, select a voice from available options, and click a button to hear the text spoken aloud using the selected voice. The application utilizes the Speech Synthesis API to generate speech from text input and provides users with various voice options for customization.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Speech Synthesis API

## Features
- Convert text input into spoken words.
- Select from a variety of available voices for speech output.

- **Speech Synthesis API**: Utilizing the Speech Synthesis API (`window.speechSynthesis`) to convert text input into spoken words.
- **Voice Selection**: Fetching available voices using `window.speechSynthesis.getVoices()` and allowing users to select from the list of voices.
- **Event Handling**: Responding to user interactions such as voice selection and text input changes to update the speech output accordingly.
